========== 06 Feb ==========

Implemented proof of concept in the java-PoC submodule (sandbox/java-PoC):
	- Command-line interface
	- Takes in acquisition time and contract definition
	- Parses contract and generates contract object (made up of combinator objects)
	- Abstract combinator object, extended by concrete combinator implementations
		- horizon, combinator type, and acquire method
	- Sub-combinators override getHorizon when needed (e.g. truncate)
	- Works pretty well until you get to a combinator which requires input, e.g. or 		and anytime
	- Evaluation is pretty simple in this form

Started Rust investigation:
	- Went through docs
	- Completed multiple rust tutorials
	- Implemented rust proof-of-concept:
		- Similar to Java
		- Has zero, one, and, truncate combinators
		- Uses traits/structs instead of objects/inheritance
		- Works pretty similarly to java PoC
	- Rust testing done in the rust-test submodule (sandbox/rust-test)

Separated git repo into submodules under one group (so that only one submodule must be downloaded at a time)
