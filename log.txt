Implemented proof of concept in sandbox/proof-of-concept:
	- Command-line interface
	- Takes in acquisition time and contract definition
	- Parses contract and generates contract object (made up of combinator objects)
	- Abstract combinator object, extended by concrete combinator implementations
		- horizon, combinator type, and acquire method
	- Sub-combinators override getHorizon when needed (e.g. truncate)
	- Works pretty well until you get to a combinator which requires input, e.g. or 		and anytime
	- Evaluation is pretty simple in this form
